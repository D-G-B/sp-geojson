Coding challenge Airsiders

We would like you to create a web app containing a single page to get

"GeoJSON features" of a location given with the coordinates (as geolocation
box).

Your application needs to make a call to open street map api (https://
www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map) gather information in "osm" format,
convert it to "GeoJSON" and properly display the dataset.
Feel free to use "osmtogeojson" to convert the data types.
Please keep in mind that the code quality, proper mocking and data
validation, unite testing and your approach to the problem is just as important
as the solution itself. Please take your time to deliver a code ideally well
tested and structured.

Please create a public repo on GitHub containing your source code, we would
like to ask you to strictly avoid mentioning the name of Airsiders on the repo
content and title (SEO purposes).

Feel free to add comments and more
information in readme file as desired.
It’s okay for the candidate to apply even if they haven’t finished the challenge.

Just make sure to write down how you would structure your solution.
If you are doing the coding challenge as a front-end engineer no need of
implementing the backend at all. You can simply make the api call from their
application directly to the Open street map
If you are doing the coding challenge as a backend engineer, there is no
need to implement any frontend code, a simple proxy route that uses open
street api as data source is well sufficient.

Good luck!
